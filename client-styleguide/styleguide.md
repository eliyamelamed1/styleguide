# React Folder Structure Documentation

## Root Level Directories

- **components/**: Contains reusable UI elements.
- **hooks/**: Holds custom React hooks for shared logic.
- **utils/**: Stores utility functions for common tasks.
- **Groups**: Parentheses denote logical grouping (e.g., (ui)/) to enhance organization and navigability.
- **Features**: Modular units of functionality, either shared or page-specific, for scalable code.

## Features
- **Shared vs. Page-Specific**:
  - Shared features are available application-wide.
  - Page-specific features are tailored for individual pages, containing all necessary logic, components, hooks, and utilities for that page.
- **Structure**: Each feature is a self-contained unit, facilitating easy reuse and maintenance.
- **Public API**: The index.js file in each feature folder serves as the entry point, exporting the feature's functionalities for application-wide use.

## Pages Directory
- Contains individual pages of the application, each potentially housing exclusive features.
- **Exclusive Features**: Features within a page directory are designed to be used exclusively by that page, emphasizing the importance of tailored functionality to enhance page performance and user experience.

## Parentheses Groups vs. Features
* Use groups to organize related files within a directory, like grouping UI components or hooks that serve similar purposes. It's about improving folder navigation and clarity without implying shared functionality.

* Use features when you have a set of components, hooks, and utilities that together deliver a specific piece of functionality. Features are self-contained, can span across multiple directories, and are designed to be either reused throughout the application or specific to a single page.

## Developer's Consideration
- Developers should actively evaluate when to organize root directory folders into groups / features as they grow, ensuring modular and maintainable code structures.
